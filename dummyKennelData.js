I like to make my throne out of any soft place to lay down, and consider my crate to be my castle.  I like to be brought treats and bones, and enjoy spending much of my day snoozing.  Like many royals, I can appear aloof to those who don't know me, but I'm actually quite goofy and like to let my true personality only show to those who are closest to me.  I'm housebroken, spayed, and up to date on vaccines.  I get along with most dogs and cats, and prefer those who give me enough space.  I have been mistreated a lot in my life, and my foster parents have helped me come a long way in learning to trust.  I would do best in a quiet home with an experienced and patient parent who will continue to help me grow.  I have so much love to give, and am looking for the forever family who wants to share the rest of my royal golden years together..My adoption fee is 195.00 and applications can be found at www.fowarescue.com \n\nJF LM"

She has a lot of energy, very smart and trainable and treat and toy motivated. Bc of this She will tend to bark and be mouthy (like puppy play mouthy-not too hard though) if she isn't given enough exercise or things to do...as you can see in the pictures  she is also fearless and agile (she originally climbed up the ramp on her own and I had to see it to believe it bc it is quite steep!). She will thrive in an active family with kids (preferably over 5 since she tends to mouth my 5 year old the most). She would to super in agility I think! A great companion for a hiker too perhaps?!\nGinger Snaps adoption fee is 295.00 and applications can be found our website www.fowarescue.com \nDL"

They didn't ask to be born. They are the sweetest babies. If you are a mom, you know all we mommies want is the best for our babies. I can't take care of them. I regret having so many babies where my human felt he couldn't take care of us. At least he surrendered us to a caring rescue.  \nMy babies are Eudora, Marcie, Peggy Jean, Linus, and Schroeder. Please check them out. I promise you will fall in love with them.\n\nFurther information: the father looks like Linus. We both weigh about 27 pounds. The information for my babies are on their profile. Please check them out. I just need to know they are being adopted by someone who will love them as much as I do"
