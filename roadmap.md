Roadmap Suggestions
===================

Suggestions for you:
--------------------

The database can handle multiple breeds on each dog inserted through the form. Currently, the form is only sending the dog to the server/DB with one breed.

The dog input form has no form validation.

The dog input form doesn't allow picture uploads (just image URLs).

We didn't use React Router to set up multiple pages, though I feel like this would be a nice addition especially creating a link for the dog input form and a "My Kennel" page that shows more details on each dog.

It would be nice if the user who input the dog into the database could manage that dog's information over time, update it when necessary, and delete the dog upon the animal's successful adoption.

Right now, the database does not delete a dog that comes back from Petfinder as "not found" -- the server only ignores that dog and does not present that animal to the client.

Make the app have an ability to present more than just dogs to the user (Petfinder will work with many species including horses, cats, and barnyard animals -- small DB modifications should make it possible to add these animals to the DT database as well).

Implementing an interactive swipe on the carousel would be great.

The "My Kennel" component was originally designed to be its own page. May be worthwhile 

Possibly tweet an animal's picture with a link back to the dog and its adoption.

When you click 'Contact Shelter' it would be nice to give the user a form that would send information directly to the shelter.
